# ABOUT
This project is interesting fun facts about the best hiking and biking trails in Texas. 10 amazing hiking trails that span the state. 6 endurance bike trails ranging from a few miles to 130 mile. The bike trails can be done at a beginner level, but some have tough terrain. I have pulled most things from the internet as I was just creating a responsive design website.
