# ABOUT
This project is interesting fun facts about the best hiking and biking trails in Texas. 10 amazing hiking trails that span the state. 6 endurance bike trails ranging from a few miles to 130 mile. The bike trails can be done at a beginner level, but some have tough terrain. I have pulled most things from the internet as I was just creating a responsive design website.

# TOOLS
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
  
- Mobile first is a design approach utilizing user        experience for mobile devices. Most people check websites and apps on their phones so using the mobile first I created the site for mobile devices.
- Responsive Design is taking into account the different screen sizes people use the Internet. Since the explosion of mobiles, tablets, laptops, and desktops it is important to give users designs for each screen size. My approach is about using CSS media queries for a larger screen. Images, font size and weight have been adjusted for the screen sizes.
